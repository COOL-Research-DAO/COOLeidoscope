# COOLeidoscope

An interactive 3D visualization using Three.js and React of exoplanetary systems and their associated data sources, connecting astronomical data, scientific research, publications, authors, public outreach content, art, and more. COOLeidoscope is a project developed by COOL Research Labs in collaboration with the COOL Research DAO community.

## About

COOLeidoscope is an application for exploring exoplanetary systems in 3D. It visualizes data about stars and their planets, allowing users to:

- Browse a collection of exoplanetary systems
- Filter systems based on various properties (star temperature, mass, planetary count, etc.)
- Interact with the 3D visualization by zooming, rotating, and selecting objects
- View detailed information about stars and planets
- Build knowledge graphs that connect astronomical data, researchers, research projects, public outreach content, and more

## Technologies

- React
- TypeScript
- Three.js / React Three Fiber
- Vite
