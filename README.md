# COOLeidoscope

An interactive 3D visualization of exoplanetary systems using Three.js and React.

## About

COOLeidoscope is an application for exploring exoplanetary systems in 3D. It visualizes data about stars and their planets, allowing users to:

- Browse a collection of exoplanetary systems
- Filter systems based on various properties (star temperature, mass, planetary count, etc.)
- Interact with the 3D visualization by zooming, rotating, and selecting objects
- View detailed information about stars and planets
- Build knowledge graphs that connect astronomical data, researchers, research projects, outreach content, and more

## Technologies
